         <h2 class="title">Friends (1994 - 2004)</h2>
         <p class="text">Three young men and three young women -- of the BFF kind -- live in the same apartment complex
            and face life and love in New York. They're not above sticking their noses into one another's business and
            swapping romantic partners, which always leads to the kind of hilarity average people will never experience
            -- especially during breakups.</p>
         <p class="paragraph">Watch Friends with a subscription on Max, or buy it on Vudu, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV
         </p>

         <p class="guys">Rachel Green (occasionally spelled Greene[16]) (Jennifer Aniston), a sheltered but friendly
            woman, flees her wedding day and wealthy yet unfulfilling life and finds childhood friend Monica Geller
            (Courteney
            Cox), a tightly wound but caring chef. Rachel becomes a waitress at West Village coffee house Central Perk
            after
            she moves into Monica's apartment, set at 90 Bedford Street,[17] above Central Perk and joins Monica's group
            of
            single friends in their mid-20s: previous roommate Phoebe Buffay (Lisa Kudrow), an odd masseuse and
            musician;
            neighbor Joey Tribbiani (Matt LeBlanc), a dim-witted yet loyal struggling actor and womanizer; Joey's
            roommate
            Chandler Bing (Matthew Perry), a sarcastic, self-deprecating data processor; and Monica's older brother and
            Chandler's college roommate Ross Geller (David Schwimmer), a sweet-natured but insecure paleontologist.</p>
         <p class="episodes">
            Episodes depict the friends' comedic and romantic adventures and career issues,
            such as Joey auditioning for roles or Rachel seeking jobs in the fashion industry. The six characters each
            have many dates
            and serious relationships, such as Monica with Richard Burke (Tom Selleck) and Ross with Emily Waltham
            (Helen Baxendale).
            Ross and Rachel's intermittent relationship is the most often-recurring storyline; during the ten seasons of
            the show,
            they repeatedly date and break up.</p>
         <p class="love">Over the course of the series, Ross briefly marries Emily, Ross and Rachel have a child
            together after an one-night stand, Chandler and Monica date and marry each other, and Phoebe marries Mike
            Hannigan
            (Paul Rudd). Other frequently recurring characters include Ross and Monica's parents Jack and Judy Geller
            (Elliott Gould and Christina Pickles) from Long Island;</p>
